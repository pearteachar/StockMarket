# StockMarket

Brief Background:
This project initially began from frustration with my broker not allowing me to see my returns on investment minus funds I deposited. Additionally, I wanted a way to keep track of my monthly dividends and a way to set 'Buy' signals. These factors, combined with my budding interest in data science, led me to write my own scripts to automate the process.

About Me:
I am a Computer Science teacher interested in the healthcare, social justice, financial, and technology fields.

My interest in healthcare and social justice stem from the same reason I am a teacher: I am committed to bringing about positive change to this world. My goal is to not only teach students how to program, but also how they can apply their programming skills for good causes. The healthcare field is a huge opportunity for change; the healthcare industry has enormous amounts of data to train machine learning models to not only better treat diseases but also to predict and prevent diseases. Social justice is another huge, overarching section for the advancement of humankind: why do we have the policies we currently do; are policies inherently discriminatory; why has our prison population burgeoned; why are prisoners counted as 'population' for where their prison is (for representative purposes) but they are not given a vote? There are so many things that are concerning that I wish to apply an analytical perspective towards.
